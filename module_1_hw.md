## Business Activities

>>* They have automated the investment process by knowing a users 'risk apetite' and displaying the multiple portfolios they can invest in and automating saving deposits that are automatically invested 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
>>* Acorns tries to target millenials without access to mainstream investment management companies. However, I believe that this platform could target alll types of people trying to increase their savings accounts. Given their flagship product (save & invest) they help people invest their savings and automating such procceses, boradening their target market

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
>>* Main feature "Round-ups" differenciastes them from their competition because they were able to automate proccess between saving and investing. Money is pulled from your checking account (amount is set by client) and it is then invested into the portfolio selected by client
>>* It offers tailored portfolio's depending on a clients risk apetite 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
>>* They have radicalized they way people think about saving and investing. They have been able to capture decent narket share (126 MM in rev. as of 12.31.2021) and been able to expand into other areas such as the credit line business and business loans 
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
>>* As of 12.31.2021: 
>>* Revenue Growth: 77.46% 
>>* Gross margin: 62.75%
>>* Operating Margin: -28.79% 
>>* Net Profit Margin: 10.52% 
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
>>* 5th in revenue share 
>>* Low operational margins as well 
>>* Overall, the firm has not been able to outperform larger competitors such as Robinhood and PayPal (Source: PitchBook) However, I would not classify with such companies given that Acorns tries to approach the way people automate savings and not directly as a broker or payment processing company


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
  >>* I would reccomend opening a brokerage branch. Given the rise in demand for self-directed investment accounts being able to merge autamted investing with the ability for users to decide where they would want to allocate capital more independently 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
>>* They would be able to capture more of the reatil investment community that apps such as Robinhood have been able to capture. If they merge their save & Invest platform with their borkerage branch they would in theory become an bank 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
>>* Brokerage service - Charles Schwab (clearing house)
>>* When compared to technology used by Robinhood this is the most relevant one as Acorns uses most of the smae services and products as Robinhood 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
>>* They would be able to leverage clearing house for faster order processing and better prices for their clients
